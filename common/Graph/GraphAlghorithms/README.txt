//  Desc:   classes to implement graph algorithms, including DFS, BFS,
//          Dijkstra's, A*, Prims etc. (based upon the code created
//          by Robert Sedgewick in his book "Algorithms in C++")
//
//          Any graphs passed to these functions must conform to the
//          same interface used by the SparseGraph
